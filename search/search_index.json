That is, a feature view does not store feature data, but is a logical grouping of features. Typically, you define a feature view because you want to train/deploy a model with exactly those features in the feature view.

An external table includes a user-defined SQL string for retrieving data, but you also perform SQL operations, including projections, aggregations, and so on. The SQL query is executed on-demand when HSFS retrieves data from the external Feature Group, for example, when creating training data using features in the external table.

Python is the most widely used framework for feature engineering due to it extensive library support for aggregations (Pandas), data validation (Great Expectations), and transformations (in Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc). SQL has grown in popularity for performing heavy lifting in feature pipelines - computing aggregates on data - when the input data already resides in a data warehouse. However, SQL is limited in its support for data validation (Great Expectations support in DBT is one way to do data validation for SQL) and transformations. Spark provides scalable, general-purpose support for feature engineering, with aggregations, data validation (Great Expecations and Deequ, for example), and transformations.

A feature group is a table of features, where each feature group has a primary key, and optionally an event_time column (indicating when the features in that row were observed), and a partition key. Collectively, they are referred to as columns. The partition key determines how to layout the feature group rows on disk such that you can efficiently query the data using queries with the partition key. For example, if your partition key is the day and you have hundreds of days worth of data, with a partition key, you can query the day for only a given day or a range of days, and only the data for those days will be read from disk.

You can also see that features in the feature view inherit not only the feature type from their feature groups, but also whether they are the primary key and/or the event_time. The image also includes transformation functions that are applied to individual features. Transformation functions are a part of the feature types included in the feature view.

You can apply filters when creating training data from a feature view: start-time and end-time, for example, to create the train-set from an earlier time range, and the test-set from a later (unseen) time range; feature value features, for example, only train a model on customers from a particular country.

The first one is to aggregate the logs of services running in your cluster in CloudWatch service in your configured AWS account. This can be useful if you want to understand what is happening on your cluster, without having to ssh into the instances. The second one is for hopsworks.ai to collect logs about the services running in your cluster. These logs will help us improve our system and provide support. If you choose to opt-out from the log collection and need support you will have to provide us the log by yourself, which will slow down the support process. Step 3 workers configuration # In this step, you configure the workers. There are two possible setups static or autoscaling. In the static setup, the cluster has a fixed number of workers that you decide. You can then add and remove workers manually, for more details: the documentation . In the autoscaling setup, you configure conditions to add and remove workers and the cluster will automatically add and remove workers depending on the demand. Static workers configuration # You can set the static configuration by selecting Disabled in the first drop-down (1). Then you select the number of workers you want to start the cluster with (2). And, select the Instance type (3) and Local storage size (4) for the worker nodes . Create a Hopsworks cluster, static workers configuration Autoscaling workers configuration # You can set the autoscaling configuration by selecting enabled in the first drop-down (1). You then have access to a two parts form allowing you to configure the autoscaling. In the first part, you configure the autoscaling for general-purpose compute nodes. In the second part, you configure the autoscaling for nodes equipped with GPUs. In both parts you will have to set up the following: The instance type you want to use. You can decide to not enable the autoscaling for GPU nodes by selecting No GPU autoscale . The size of the instances' disk. The minimum number of workers. The maximum number of workers. The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources in standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the amount of workers you want to be in standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook request the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster.

In this step, you choose the retention period in days. You can deactivate the retention policy by setting this value to 0 but this will block you from taking any backup of your cluster. Choose the backup retention policy Step 7 Managed Containers # Hopsworks can integrate with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and ML model servings on top of Amazon EKS. For more detail on how to set up this integration refer to Integration with Amazon EKS and Amazon ECR . Add EKS cluster name Step 8 VPC selection # In this step, you can select the VPC which will be used by the Hopsworks cluster. You can either select an existing VPC or let Hopsworks.ai create one for you. If you decide to let Hopsworks.ai create the VPC for you, you can choose the CIDR block for this virtual network. Refer to Create a VPC for more details on how to create your own VPC in AWS. Choose a VPC Note If the VPC uses a custom domain read our guide on how to set this up Step 9 Availability Zone selection # If you selected an existing VPC in the previous step, this step lets you select which availability zone of this VPC to use. If you did not select an existing virtual network in the previous step Hopsworks.ai will create an availability zone for you. You can choose the CIDR block this subnet will use. Choose an availability zone Step 10 Security group selection # If you selected an existing VPC in the previous step, this step lets you select which security group to use. Note Hopsworks.ai require some rules for inbound and outbound traffic in your security group, for more details refer to inbound traffic rules and outbound traffic rules . Note Hopsworks.ai attaches a public ip to your cluster by default. However, you can disable this behavior by unchecking the Attach Public IP checkbox. Choose security group Limiting outbound traffic to Hopsworks.ai # Clusters created on Hopsworks.ai need to be able to send http requests to api.hopsworks.ai. If you have strict regulation regarding outbound traffic, you can enable the Use static IPs to communicate with Hopsworks.ai checkbox to get a list of IPs to be allowed as shown below: Enable static IPs Step 11 User management selection # In this step, you can choose which user management system to use. You have four choices: Managed : Hopsworks.ai automatically adds and removes users from the Hopsworks cluster when you add and remove users from your organization (more details here ). OAuth2 : integrate the cluster with your organization's OAuth2 identity provider. See Use OAuth2 for user management for more detail. LDAP : integrate the cluster with your organization's LDAP/ActiveDirectory server. See Use LDAP for user management for more detail. Disabled : let you manage users manually from within Hopsworks. Choose user management type Step 12 Managed RonDB # Hopsworks uses RonDB as a database engine for its online Feature Store. By default database will run on its own VM. Premium users can scale-out database services to multiple VMs to handle increased workload. For details on how to configure RonDB check our guide here . Configure RonDB If you need to deploy a RonDB cluster instead of a single node please contact us . Step 13 add tags to your instances. # In this step, you can define tags that will be added to the cluster virtual machines. Add tags Step 14 add an init script to your instances. # In this step, you can enter an initialization script that will be run at startup on every instance. You can select whether this script will run before or after the VM configuration. Be cautious if you select to run it before the VM configuration as this might affect Cluster creation. Note this init script must be a bash script starting with #!/usr/bin/env bash Add initialization script Step 15 Review and create # Review all information and select Create : Review cluster information The cluster will start. This will take a few minutes: Booting Hopsworks cluster As soon as the cluster has started, you will be able to log in to your new Hopsworks cluster. You will also be able to stop, restart, or terminate the cluster.

The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources in standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the amount of workers you want to be in standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook request the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster.

The output should be: configmap/aws-auth edited Step 4: Setup network connectivity # For Hopsworks to be able to start containers in the EKS cluster and for these containers to be able to use Hopsworks we need to establish network connectivity between Hopsworks and EKS. For this, we have two solutions. The first option ( A ) is to run Hopsworks and EKS in the same virtual network and security group. The second option ( B ) is to pair the EKS and Hopsworks virtual networks. If you choose this option, make sure to create the peering before starting the Hopsworks cluster as it connects to EKS at startup. Option A : run Hopsworks and EKS in the same virtual network. # Running EKS and Hopsworks in the same security group is the simplest of the two solutions when it comes to setting up the system. All you need to do is to open the ports needed by Hopsworks in the security group created by the EKS cluster. Then you can just select this security group during the Hopsworks cluster creation. We will now see how to open the ports for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) to allow Hopsworks to run with all its functionalities. Note It is possible not to open ports 80 and 443 at the cost of some features. See Limiting permissions for more details. First, you need to get the name of the security group of your EKS cluster by using the following eksctl command. Notice that you need to replace my-eks-cluster with the name of your cluster. eksctl utils describe-stacks --region = us-east-2 --cluster = my-eks-cluster | grep 'OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\"' -a1 Check the output for OutputValue , which will be the id of your EKS security group. ExportName: \"eksctl-my-eks-cluster-cluster::ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputValue: \"YOUR_EKS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID\" Go to the Security Groups section of EC2 in the AWS management console and search for your security group using the id obtained above. Note the VPC ID , you will need it when creating the hopsworks cluster. Then, click on it then go to the Inbound rules tab and click on Edit inbound rules . You should now see the following screen. Edit inbound rules Add two rules for HTTP and HTTPS as follows: Edit inbound rules Click Save rules to save the updated rules to the security group. Option B : create a pairing between Hopsworks and EKS # To establish virtual peering between the Kubernetes cluster and Hopsworks, you need to select or create a virtual network for Hopsworks. You can create the virtual network by following the AWS documentation steps to create the virtual private network . Make sure to configure your subnet to use an address space that does not overlap with the address space in the Kubernetes network. You then need to select or create a security group for the Hopsworks VPC. You can create the security group by following the steps in the AWS documentation . Remember to open the port for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) to allow Hopsworks to run with all its functionalities. Note It is possible not to open ports 80 and 443 at the cost of some features. See Limiting permissions for more details. Once the Hopsworks VPC and security group are created you need to create a peering between the Hopsworks VPC and the EKS VPC. For this follow the AWS documentation here . Finally, you need to edit the security groups for the EKS cluster and for Hopsworks to allow full communication between both VPC. This can be done following the instruction in the AWS documentation . You can get the name of the security group of your EKS cluster by using the following eksctl command. Notice that you need to replace my-eks-cluster with the name of your cluster. eksctl utils describe-stacks --region = us-east-2 --cluster = my-eks-cluster | grep 'OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\"' -a1 Check the output for OutputValue , which will be the id of your EKS security group. ExportName: \"eksctl-my-eks-cluster-cluster::ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputKey: \"ClusterSecurityGroupId\" , OutputValue: \"YOUR_EKS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID\" Step 5: Allow Hopsworks.ai to delete ECR repositories on your behalf # For hopsworks.ai to be able to clean up the ECR repo when terminating your hopsworks cluster, you need to add a new inline policy to the Cross-Account role or user connected to Hopsworks.ai , that you set up when connecting your AWS account to hopsworks.ai . Navigate to AWS management console , then click on Roles or Users depending on which connection method you have used in Hopsworks.ai, and then search for your role or user name and click on it. Go to the Permissions tab, click on Add inline policy and go to the JSON tab. Replace the existing JSON permissions with the JSON permissions below. Click on Review policy , name it, and click Create policy . { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Sid\" : \"AllowDeletingECRRepositories\" , \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"ecr:DeleteRepository\" ], \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:ecr:*:*:repository/*/filebeat\" , \"arn:aws:ecr:*:*:repository/*/base\" ] } ] } Step 6: Create a Hopsworks cluster with EKS and ECR support # In Hopsworks.ai, select Create cluster . Choose the region of your EKS cluster and fill in the name of your S3 bucket , then click Next: Create Hopsworks cluster Choose your preferred SSH key to use with the cluster, then click Next: Choose SSH key Choose the instance profile role that you have created in Step 2 (click on the refresh button if your instance profile is not in the list), then click Next: Choose instance profile role Choose the backup retention period and click Next: Choose the backup retention policy Choose Enabled to enable the use of Amazon EKS and ECR: Choose Enabled Add your EKS cluster name, then click Next: Add EKS cluster name If you followed option A when setting up the network Choose the VPC of your EKS cluster. Its name should have the form eksctl-YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME-cluster (click on the refresh button if the VPC is not in the list). If you followed option B choose the VPC you created during Step 4 . Choose VPC Choose any of the subnets in the VPC, then click Next. Note Avoid private subnets if you want to enjoy all the hopsworks features . Choose Subnet Choose the security group that you have updated/created in Step 4 , then click Next: Note If you followed option A select the Security Group with the same id as in Step 4 and NOT the ones containing ControlPlaneSecurity or ClusterSharedNode in their name. Choose Security Group Click Review and submit , then Create. Once the cluster is created, Hopsworks will use EKS to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and ML model servings.","title":"EKS/ECR integration"},{"location":"setup_installation/aws/eks_ecr_integration/#integration-with-amazon-eks-and-amazon-ecr","text":"This guide shows how to create a cluster in Hopsworks.ai with integrated support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

By default, these permissions are set to easily allow a wide range of different configurations and allow us to automate as many steps as possible. While we ensure to never access resources we shouldn\u2019t, we do understand that this might not be enough for your organization or security policy. This guide explains how to lock down AWS permissions following the IT security policy principle of least privilege allowing Hopsworks.ai to only access resources in a specific VPC. Limiting the cross-account role permissions # Step 1: Create a VPC # To restrict Hopsworks.ai from accessing resources outside of a specific VPC, you need to create a new VPC connected to an Internet Gateway. This can be achieved in the AWS Management Console following this guide: Create the VPC . The option VPC with a Single Public Subnet from the Launch VPC Wizard should work out of the box. Alternatively, an existing VPC such as the default VPC can be used and Hopsworks.ai will be restricted to this VPC. Note the VPC ID of the VPC you want to use for the following steps. Note Make sure you enable DNS hostnames for your VPC After you have created the VPC either Create a Security Group or use VPC's default. Make sure that the VPC allow the following traffic. Inbound traffic # The Security Group and/or Network ACLs need to be configured so that at least port 80 is reachable from the internet otherwise you will have to use self signed certificate in your Hopsworks cluster. It is imperative the Security Group allows Inbound traffic from any Instance within the same Security Group in any (TCP) port. All VMs of the Cluster should be able to communicate with each other. Outbound traffic # Clusters created on Hopsworks.ai need to be able to send http requests to api.hopsworks.ai . The api.hopsworks.ai domain use a content delivery network for better performance. This result in the impossibility to predict which IP the request will be sent to. If you require a list of static IPs to allow outbound traffic from your security group, use the static IPs option during cluster creation . Similar to Inbound traffic, the Security Group in place must allow Outbound traffic in any (TCP) port towards any VM withing the same Security Group. Note If you intend to use the managed users option on your Hopsworks cluster you should also allow outbound traffic to cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com and managedhopsworks-prod.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com . Step 2: Create an instance profile # You need to create an instance profile that will identify all instances started by Hopsworks.ai. Follow this guide to create a role to be used by EC2 with no permissions attached: Creating a Role for an AWS Service (Console) . Take note of the ARN of the role you just created. You will need to add permissions to the instance profile to give access to the S3 bucket where Hopsworks will store its data. For more details about these permissions check our guide here . Check bellow for more information on restricting the permissions given the instance profile. Step 3: Set permissions of the cross-account role # During the account setup for Hopsworks.ai, you were asked to create and provide a cross-account role. If you don\u2019t remember which role you used then you can find it in Settings/Account Settings in Hopsworks.ai. Edit this role in the AWS Management Console and overwrite the existing inline policy with the following policy. Note that you have to replace [INSTANCE_PROFILE_NAME] and [VPC_ID] for multiple occurrences in the given policy.

This enables Hopsworks to launch Python jobs, Jupyter servers, and serve models on top of AKS. Hopsworks AKS and ACR integration have four requirements: A virtual network with access to AKS pods and the AKS API servers One Azure container registry configured in your account One AKS cluster Permissions to the ACR and AKS attached to a user-managed identity This guide provides an example setup with a private AKS cluster and public ACR. Note A public AKS cluster means the Kubernetes API server is accessible outside the virtual network it is deployed in. Similarly, a public ACR is accessible through the internet. User assigned managed identity (managed identity) # Note A user assigned managed identity (managed identity) can be created at the subscription level or to a specific resource group in a subscription. The managed identity is attached to the virtual machines that run inside your subscription (or resource group). Hence, the permissions only apply to services that run within your subscription (or resource group). The AKS and ACR integration requires some permissions to be attached to the managed identity used by the Hopsworks cluster. If you have already created a user assigned managed identity for the storage continue to Add role assignment to the managed identity using this identity. To set up the managed identity, go to the resource group where you will add the managed identity - this should be the same resource group you will deploy Hopsworks in. Click on the Add button. In the search dialog, enter \"user assigned managed identity\" . Click on Create . Then give a name to the managed identity and make sure that it is in the Region where you will deploy your cluster. Click on Review + create , and click on Create . Add role assignment to the managed identity # Go to the managed identity created above. Click on Azure role assignments in the left column. Click on Add role assignment . For the Scope select Resource group or Subscription depending on your preference. Select the Role AcrPull and click on Save . Repeat the same operation with the following roles: AcrPull AcrPush AcrDelete Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User Role Warning You will also need to attach storage access permissions to the managed identity, see Creating and configuring a storage Once finished the role assignments should look similar to the picture below. AKS permissions Private AKS cluster and public ACR # This guide will step through setting up a private AKS cluster and a public ACR. Step 1: Create an AKS cluster # Go to Kubernetes services in the azure portal and click Add then Add Kubernetes cluster . Place the Kubernetes cluster in the same resource group and region as the Hopsworks cluster and choose a name for the Kubernetes cluster. AKS general configuration Next, click on the Authentication tab and verify the settings are as follow: Authentication method: System-assigned managed identity Role-based access control (RBAC): Enabled AKS-managed Azure Active Directory: Disabled Note Currently, AKS is only supported through managed identities. Contact the Logical Clocks sales team if you have a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. AKS authencation configuration Next, go to the networking tab and check Azure CNI . The portal will automatically fill in the IP address ranges for the Kubernetes virtual network. Take note of the virtual network name that is created, in this example the virtual network name was hopsworksstagevnet154. Lastly, check the Enable private cluster option. AKS network configuration Next, go to the Integrations tab. Under container registry click Create new. AKS create ACR Choose a name for the registry and select premium for the SKU. Then press OK . ACR configuration Next press Review + create , then click Create . To prevent the registry from filling up with unnecessary images and artifacts you can enable a retention policy. A retention policy will automatically remove untagged manifests after a specified number of days. To enable a retention policy, go to the registry you created. Go to the Retention (preview) tab and set Status from disabled to enabled . Set the retention policy for 7 days as in the figure below, then press save . ACR retention policy Step 2: create a virtual network for the Hopsworks cluster # Because the Kubernetes API service is private the Hopsworks cluster must be able to reach it over a private network. There are two options to integrate with a private AKS cluster. The first option ( A ) is to put the Hopsworks cluster in a pre-defined virtual network with a peering setup to the Kubernetes network. The second option ( B ) is to create a subnet inside the Kubernetes virtual network where the Hopsworks cluster will be placed. Option A : Peering setup # To establish virtual peering between the Kubernetes cluster and Hopsworks, you need to select or create a virtual network for Hopsworks. Go to virtual networks and press create. Choose a name for the new virtual network and select the same resource group you are planning to use for your Hopsworks cluster. Next, go to the IP Addresses tab. Create an address space that does not overlap with the address space in the Kubernetes network. In the previous example, the automatically created Kubernetes network used the address space 10.0.0.0/8 . Hence, the address space 172.18.0.0/16 can safely be used. Next click Review + Create , then Create . Next, go to the created virtual network and go to the Peerings tab. Then click Add . Virtual network peering Choose a name for the peering link.

Hopsworks.ai collects logs about the services running in your cluster to help us improve our system and to provide support. If you choose to opt-out from the log collection and need support you will have to provide us the log by yourself, which will slow down the support process. Step 3 workers configuration # In this step, you configure the workers. There are two possible setups static or autoscaling. In the static setup, the cluster has a fixed number of workers that you decide. You can then add and remove workers manually, for more details: the documentation . In the autoscaling setup, you configure conditions to add and remove workers and the cluster will automatically add and remove workers depending on the demand. Static workers configuration # You can set the static configuration by selecting Disabled in the first drop-down (1). Then you select the number of workers you want to start the cluster with (2). And, select the Instance type (3) and Local storage size (4) for the worker nodes . Create a Hopsworks cluster, static workers configuration Autoscaling workers configuration # You can set the autoscaling configuration by selecting enabled in the first drop-down (1). You then have access to a two parts form allowing you to configure the autoscaling. In the first part, you configure the autoscaling for general-purpose compute nodes. In the second part, you configure the autoscaling for nodes equipped with GPUs. In both parts you will have to set up the following: The instance type you want to use. You can decide to not enable the autoscaling for GPU nodes by selecting No GPU autoscale . The size of the instances' disk. The minimum number of workers. The maximum number of workers. The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources in standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the amount of workers you want to be in standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook request the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster.

While we ensure to never access resources we shouldn\u2019t, we do understand that this might not be enough for your organization or security policy. This guide explains how to lock down access permissions following the IT security policy principle of least privilege. Limiting the cross-account role permissions # Step 1: Create a virtual network and subnet # To restrict Hopsworks.ai from having write and delete access on virtual networks and subnet you need to create them manually. This can be achieved in the Azure portal following this guide: Create a virtual network . Make sure to use the resource group and location in which you intend to deploy your Hopsworks cluster. For the remaining of the configuration, the default options proposed by the portal should work out of the box. Note the names of the virtual network and subnet you want to use for the following steps. Step 2: Create a network security group # To restrict Hopsworks.ai from having write and delete access on network security groups you need to create it manually. This can be achieved in the Azure portal following this guide: Create a network security group . Make sure to use the resource group and location in which you intend to deploy your Hopsworks cluster. Inbound traffic # For Hopsworks.ai to create the SSL certificates the network security group needs to allow inbound traffic on port 80.

Setting the destination port ranges to 80 and letting the default values for the other fields should work out of the box. Note If you intend to use the managed users option on your Hopsworks cluster you should also add a rule to open port 443. Outbound traffic # Clusters created on Hopsworks.ai need to be able to send http requests to api.hopsworks.ai . The api.hopsworks.ai domain use a content delivery network for better performance. This result in the impossibility to predict which IP the request will be sent to.

Note If you intend to use the managed users option on your Hopsworks cluster you should also allow outbound traffic to cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com and managedhopsworks-prod.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com . Step 3: Set permissions of the cross-account role # During the account setup for Hopsworks.ai, you were asked to create create a custom role for your resource group. Edit this role in the Azure portal by going to your resource group, clicking on Access control (IAM) , opening the tab Roles , searching for the role you created, clicking on the three dots at the end of the role line and clicking on edit.

After you finish working with the cluster, you can terminate it along with the other AZURE resources using the following command terraform destroy Importing an existing cluster to terraform # In this section, we show how to use terraform import to manage your existing Hopsworks cluster. Step 1 : In your Hopsworks.ai dashboard , choose the cluster you want to import to terraform, then go to the Details tab and copy the Id as shown in the figure below Click on the Details tab and copy the Id Step 2 : In your terminal, create an empty directory and cd to it. mkdir import-demo cd import-demo Step 3 : In this empty directory, create an empty file versions.tf . Open the file and paste the following configurations. Note Notice that you need to change these configurations depending on your cluster, in this example, the Hopsworks cluster reside in region us-east-2 on AWS. terraform { required_providers { aws = { source = \"hashicorp/aws\" version = \"4.16.0\" } hopsworksai = { source = \"logicalclocks/hopsworksai\" } } } provider \"aws\" { region = us-east-2 } provider \"hopsworksai\" { } Step 4 : Initialize the terraform directory by running the following command terraform init Step 5 : Create another file main.tf . Open the file and paste the following configuration. resource \"hopsworksai_cluster\" \"cluster\" { } Step 6 : Import the cluster state using terraform import , in this step you need the cluster id from Step 1 (33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565). terraform import hopsworksai_cluster.cluster 33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565 The output should be similar to the following snippet hopsworksai_cluster.cluster: Importing from ID \"33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565\" ... hopsworksai_cluster.cluster: Import prepared!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform. Step 7 : At that moment the local terraform state is updated, however, if we try to run terraform plan or terraform apply it will complain about missing configurations. The reason is that our local resource configuration in main.tf is empty, we should populate it using the terraform state commands as shown below: terraform show -no-color > main.tf Step 8 : If you try to run terraform plan again, the command will complain that the read-only attributes are set (Computed attributes) as shown below. The solution is to remove these attributes from the main.tf and retry again until you have no errors.

Step 9 : Once you have fixed all the errors, you should get the following output when running terraform plan . With that, you can proceed as normal to manage this cluster locally using terraform. hopsworksai_cluster.cluster: Refreshing state... [ id = 33ae7ae0-d03c-11eb-84e2-af555fb63565 ] No changes.

General configuration Step 3 workers configuration # In this step, you configure the workers. There are two possible setups: static or autoscaling. In the static setup, the cluster has a fixed number of workers that you decide. You can then add and remove workers manually, for more details: documentation . In the autoscaling setup, you configure conditions to add and remove workers and the cluster will automatically add and remove workers depending on the demand, for more details: documentation . Static workers configuration # You can set the static configuration by selecting Disabled in the first drop-down (1). Then you select the number of workers you want to start the cluster with (2).

Create a Hopsworks cluster, static workers configuration Autoscaling workers configuration # You can set the autoscaling configuration by selecting enabled in the first drop-down (1). You then have access to a two parts form, allowing you to configure the autoscaling. In the first part, you configure the autoscaling for general-purpose compute nodes. In the second part, you configure the autoscaling for nodes equipped with GPUs. In both parts you will have to set up the following: The instance type you want to use. You can decide to not enable the autoscaling for GPU nodes by selecting No GPU autoscale . The size of the instances' disk. The minimum number of workers. The maximum number of workers. The targeted number of standby workers. Setting some resources on standby ensures that there are always some free resources in your cluster. This ensures that requests for new resources are fulfilled promptly. You configure the standby by setting the number of workers you want to be on standby. For example, if you set a value of 0.5 the system will start a new worker every time the aggregated free cluster resources drop below 50% of a worker's resources. If you set this value to 0 new workers will only be started when a job or notebook requests the resources. The time to wait before removing unused resources. One often starts a new computation shortly after finishing the previous one. To avoid having to wait for workers to stop and start between each computation it is recommended to wait before shutting down workers. Here you set the amount of time in seconds resources need to be unused before they get removed from the system. Note The standby will not be taken into account if you set the minimum number of workers to 0 and no resources are used in the cluster. This ensures that the number of nodes can fall to 0 when no resources are used. The standby will start to take effect as soon as you start using resources. Create a Hopsworks cluster, autoscale workers configuration Step 4 select the Service Account # Hopsworks cluster store their data in a storage bucket. To let the cluster instances access the bucket we need to attach a Service Account to the virtual machines. In this step, you set which Service Account to use by entering its Email . This Service Account needs to have access right to the bucket you selected in Step 2 . For more details on how to create the Service Account and give it access to the bucket refer to Creating and configuring a storage Set the instance service account Step 5 set the backup retention policy # To backup the storage bucket data when taking a cluster backup we need to set a retention policy for the bucket. In this step, you choose the retention period in days. You can deactivate the retention policy by setting this value to 0 but this will block you from taking any backup of your cluster. Choose the backup retention policy Step 6 VPC and Subnet selection # You can select the VPC which will be used by the Hopsworks cluster. You can either select an existing VPC or let Hopsworks.ai create one for you. If you decide to use restricted hopsworks.ai permissions (see restrictive-permissions for more details) you will need to select an existing VPC here. Select the vpc If you selected an existing VPC in the previous step, this step lets you select which subnet of this VPC to use. If you did not select an existing virtual network in the previous step Hopsworks.ai will create a subnet for you. You can choose the CIDR block this subnet will use. Select the Subnet to be used by your cluster and press Next . Select the subnet Step 7 User management selection # In this step, you can choose which user management system to use. You have three choices: Managed : Hopsworks.ai automatically adds and removes users from the Hopsworks cluster when you add and remove users from your organization (more details here ). OAuth2 : integrate the cluster with your organization's OAuth2 identity provider. See Use OAuth2 for user management for more detail. LDAP : integrate the cluster with your organization's LDAP/ActiveDirectory server. See Use LDAP for user management for more detail. Disabled : let you manage users manually from within Hopsworks. Choose user management type Step 8 Managed RonDB # Hopsworks uses RonDB as a database engine for its online Feature Store. By default database will run on its own VM. Premium users can scale-out database services to multiple VMs to handle increased workload. For details on how to configure RonDB check our guide here . Configure RonDB If you need to deploy a RonDB cluster instead of a single node please contact us . Step 9 add tags to your instances. # In this step, you can define tags that will be added to the cluster virtual machines. Add tags Step 10 add an init script to your instances. # In this step, you can enter an initialization script that will be run at startup on every instance. You can select whether this script will run before or after the VM configuration. Be cautious if you select to run it before the VM configuration as this might affect Cluster creation. Note this init script must be a bash script starting with #!/usr/bin/env bash Add initialization script Step 11 Review and create # Review all information and select Create : Review cluster information The cluster will start. This will take a few minutes: Booting Hopsworks cluster As soon as the cluster has started, you will be able to log in to your new Hopsworks cluster.

Prerequisite # To follow the instruction of this page you will need the following: - A GCP project in which the hopsworks cluster will be deployed. - The gcloud CLI - The gsutil tool Step 1: Connecting your GCP account # Hopsworks.ai deploys Hopsworks clusters to a project in your GCP account. Hopsworks.ai uses service account keys to connect to your GCP project. To enable this, you need to create a service account in your GCP project. Assign to the service account the required permissions. And, create a service account key JSON. For more details about creating and managing service accounts steps in GCP, see documentation . In Hopsworks.ai click on Connect to GCP or go to Settings and click on Configure next to GCP . This will direct you to a page with the instructions needed to create the service account and set up the connection. Follow the instructions.

Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide we suggest you read the Feature Group concept page to understand what a feature group is and how it fits in the ML pipeline. We also suggest you familiarize with the APIs to create a feature group . Feature group schema # When a feature is stored in the both the online and offline feature stores, it will be stored in a data type native to each store. Offline data type : The data type of the feature when stored on the offline feature store Online data type : The data type of the feature when stored on the online feature store. The offline data type is always required, even if the feature group is stored only online. On the other hand, if the feature group is not online_enabled , its features will not have an online data type. The offline and online types for each feature are identified based on the types of the columns in the Spark or Pandas DataFrame, and those types are then mapped to the online and offline data types. In the case of a Spark DataFrame, the Spark types will be mapped to the corresponding Hive Metastore type and used as offline data type. When registering a Pandas DataFrame as a feature group, the following mapping rules are applied: Pandas Type Offline Feature Type int32 INT int64 BIGINT float32 FLOAT float64 DOUBLE datetime64[ns] TIMESTAMP object STRING If the feature group is online enabled, Hopsworks will then map the offline data type to the corresponding online data type. The mapping is based on the following rules: If the offline data type is also supported on the online feature store (e.g. INT, FLOAT, DATE, TIMESTAMP), the online data type will be the same as the offline data type If the offline data type is boolean , the online data type is going to be set as tinyint If the offline data type is string , the online data type is going to be set as varchar(100) If the offline data type is not supported by the online feature store and it is not one of the above exception, the online data type will be set as varbinary(100) to handle complex types. Offline data types # The offline feature store is based on Apache Hudi and Hive Metastore, as such, any Hive Data Type can be leveraged. Potential offline types are: \"TINYINT\" , \"SMALLINT\" , \"INT\" , \"BIGINT\" , \"FLOAT\" , \"DOUBLE\" , \"DECIMAL\" , \"TIMESTAMP\" , \"DATE\" , \"STRING\" , \"BOOLEAN\" , \"BINARY\" , \"ARRAY <TINYINT>\" , \"ARRAY <SMALLINT>\" , \"ARRAY <INT>\" , \"ARRAY <BIGINT>\" , \"ARRAY <FLOAT>\" , \"ARRAY <DOUBLE>\" , \"ARRAY <DECIMAL>\" , \"ARRAY <TIMESTAMP>\" , \"ARRAY <DATE>\" , \"ARRAY <STRING>\" , \"ARRAY <BOOLEAN>\" , \"ARRAY <BINARY>\" , \"ARRAY <ARRAY <FLOAT> >\" , \"ARRAY <ARRAY <INT> >\" , \"ARRAY <ARRAY <STRING> >\" , \"MAP <FLOAT, FLOAT>\" , \"MAP <FLOAT, STRING>\" , \"MAP <FLOAT, INT>\" , \"MAP <FLOAT, BINARY>\" , \"MAP <INT, INT>\" , \"MAP <INT, STRING>\" , \"MAP <INT, BINARY>\" , \"MAP <INT, FLOAT>\" , \"MAP <INT, ARRAY <FLOAT> >\" , \"STRUCT < label: STRING, index: INT >\" , \"UNIONTYPE < STRING, INT>\" Online data types # The online storage is based on RonDB and hence, any MySQL Data Type can be leveraged. Potential online types are: \"None\" , \"INT(11)\" , \"TINYINT(1)\" , \"SMALLINT(5)\" , \"MEDIUMINT(7)\" , \"BIGINT(20)\" , \"FLOAT\" , \"DOUBLE\" , \"DECIMAL\" , \"DATE\" , \"DATETIME\" , \"TIMESTAMP\" , \"TIME\" , \"YEAR\" , \"CHAR\" , \"VARCHAR(n)\" , \"BINARY\" , \"VARBINARY(n)\" , \"BLOB\" , \"TEXT\" , \"TINYBLOB\" , \"TINYTEXT\" , \"MEDIUMBLOB\" , \"MEDIUMTEXT\" , \"LONGBLOB\" , \"LONGTEXT\" , \"JSON\" Complex online data types # Additionally to the online types above, Hopsworks allows users to store complex types (e.g. ARRAY ) on the online feature store. Hopsworks serializes the complex features transparently and stores them as VARBINARY in the online feature store. The serialization happens when calling the save() , insert() or insert_stream() methods. The deserialization will be executed when calling the get_serving_vector() method to retrieve data from the online feature store. If users query directly the online feature store, for instance using the fs.sql(\"SELECT ...\", online=True) statement, it will return a binary blob. On the feature store UI, the online feature type for complex features will be reported as VARBINARY . Online restrictions for primary key data types: # When a feature is being used as a primary key, certain types are not allowed. Examples of such types are Float , Double , Date , Text , Blob and Complex Types (e.g. Array<>). Additionally the size of the sum of the primary key online data types storage requirements should not exceed 3KB.

Offline data type : The data type of the feature when stored on the offline feature store Online data type : The data type of the feature when stored on the online feature store. The offline data type is always required, even if the feature group is stored only online. On the other hand, if the feature group is not online_enabled , its features will not have an online data type. The offline and online types for each feature are identified based on the types of the columns in the Spark or Pandas DataFrame, and those types are then mapped to the online and offline data types. In the case of a Spark DataFrame, the Spark types will be mapped to the corresponding Hive Metastore type and used as offline data type. When registering a Pandas DataFrame as a feature group, the following mapping rules are applied: Pandas Type Offline Feature Type int32 INT int64 BIGINT float32 FLOAT float64 DOUBLE datetime64[ns] TIMESTAMP object STRING If the feature group is online enabled, Hopsworks will then map the offline data type to the corresponding online data type. The mapping is based on the following rules: If the offline data type is also supported on the online feature store (e.g. INT, FLOAT, DATE, TIMESTAMP), the online data type will be the same as the offline data type If the offline data type is boolean , the online data type is going to be set as tinyint If the offline data type is string , the online data type is going to be set as varchar(100) If the offline data type is not supported by the online feature store and it is not one of the above exception, the online data type will be set as varbinary(100) to handle complex types.","title":"Feature group schema"},{"location":"user_guides/fs/feature_group/data_types/#offline-data-types","text":"The offline feature store is based on Apache Hudi and Hive Metastore, as such, any Hive Data Type can be leveraged.

For numerical features Hopsworks also computes the minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation and the sum of each feature. Enabled by default. Histograms : Hopsworks computes the distribution of the values of a feature. Exact histograms are computed as long as the number of distinct values is less than 20. If a feature has a numerical data type (e.g. integer, float, double, ...) and has more than 20 unique values, then the values are bucketed in 20 buckets and the histogram represents the distribution of values in those buckets. By default histograms are disabled. Correlation : If enabled, Hopsworks computes the Pearson correlation between features of numerical data type within a feature group. By default correlation is disabled. Exact Statistics : Exact statistics are an enhancement of the descriptive statistics that provide an exact count of distinctive values, entropy, uniqueness and distinctivness of the value of a feature. These statistics are more expensive to compute as they take into consideration all the values and they don't use approximations. By default they are disabled.

Should be in the format of [UUID].eu-west-1.redshift.amazonaws.com . Database name: The name of the database to query. Database port: The port of the cluster. Defaults to 5349. Authentication method: There are two options available for authenticating with the Redshift cluster. The first option is to configure a username and a password. The second option is to configure an IAM role. With IAM roles, Jobs or notebooks launched on Hopsworks do not need to explicitly authenticate with Redshift, as the HSFS library will transparently use the IAM role to acquire a temporary credential to authenticate the specified user.

Popular file formats are CSV or PARQUET . There are so called Data Lake House technologies such as Delta Lake or Apache Hudi, building an additional layer on top of object based storage with files, to provide database semantics like ACID transactions among others. This has the advantage that cheap storage can be turned into a cloud native data warehouse. These kind of storages are often the source for raw data from which features can be engineered. In this guide, you will configure a Storage Connector in Hopsworks to save all the authentication information needed in order to set up a connection to your AWS S3 bucket. When you're finished, you'll be able to read files using Spark through HSFS APIs. You can also use the connector to write out training data from the Feature Store, in order to make it accessible by third parties. Note Currently, it is only possible to create storage connectors in the Hopsworks UI. You cannot create a storage connector programmatically. Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide you'll need to retrieve the following information from your AWS S3 account and bucket: Bucket: You will need a S3 bucket that you have access to. The bucket is identified by its name. Authentication Method: You can authenticate using Access Key/Secret, or use IAM roles. If you want to use an IAM role it either needs to be attached to the entire Hopsworks cluster or Hopsworks needs to be able to assume the role. See IAM role documentation for more information. TODO: add link Server Side Encryption details: If your bucket has server side encryption (SSE) enabled, make sure you know which algorithm it is using (AES256 or SSE-KMS).

These roles can be configured in AWS and mapped to a project in Hopsworks. Prerequisites # Before you begin this guide you'll need the following: A Hopsworks cluster running on EC2. Role chaining setup in AWS. Configure role mappings in Hopsworks. For a guide on how to configure this see AWS IAM Role Chaining . UI # In this guide, you will learn how to use a mapped IAM role in your project. Step 1: Navigate to your project's IAM Role Chaining tab # In the Project Settings page you can find the IAM Role Chaining section showing a list of all IAM roles mapped to your project. Role Chaining Step 2: Assign default IAM roles to groups in you project # Setting a default will allow you to call assume_role in code without specifying a role ARN. You can assign (if you are a Data owner in a project) a default role to a role in your project by clicking on the default checkbox of a role mapping. You can set one default per project role. If a default is set for a project role (Data scientist or Data owner) and all members (ALL) the default set for the project role will take precedence over the default set for all members. Code # You can then use the Hops python library and Hops java/scala library to assume the roles listed in your Project Settings -> IAM Role Chaining page. When calling assume_role you can pass the role ARN string or use the get role method that takes the role id as an argument. If you assign a default role for your project you can call assume_role without arguments. python # from hops.credentials_provider import get_role , assume_role credentials = assume_role ( role_arn = get_role ( 1 )) spark . read . csv ( \"s3a://resource/test.csv\" ) . show () scala # import io . hops . util . CredentialsProvider val creds = CredentialsProvider . assumeRole ( CredentialsProvider . getRole ( 1 )) spark . read . csv ( \"s3a://resource/test.csv\" ). show () The assume_role method sets spark hadoop configurations that will allow spark to read s3 buckets.
